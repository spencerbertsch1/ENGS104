Final Project  

The goal of this project is to show the performance impacts of heuristics on Dijkstra's algorithm applied to images (jpeg) representations of randomly generated graphs. 

For example, simulations are used to determine the empirical relationship between the distance of allowed neighbors and shortest path weight, both with and without the restrictions applied using Bresenham's line algorithm. Other metrics are also varied in the analysis including the distance measurement (Euclidean vs. manhattan) that Dijkstra’s algorithm uses to find the shortest path.  

Real world applications could involve network planning analysis in which ‘worst case’ costs can be estimated and compared to costs of a path that could cut through corners of obstacles or jump over a wall in order to reach the goal.
